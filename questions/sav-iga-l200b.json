        "type": "checkbox",
        "explanation": "In Saviynt, workflows define how access requests are routed for approvals. If approvals are not being assigned correctly, the issue could lie in the workflow configuration at either the Security System level or the Endpoint level. The Security System workflow ensures that general access requests for connected systems follow the defined approval chain, while the Endpoint workflow handles specific application-level access requests. Misconfigured workflows at either level can result in requests being routed to the wrong approver or not being routed at all. Delegation and manual selection errors are less common causes in this context but should still be considered during troubleshooting.",

To manage these effectively in Saviynt EIC, you should utilize the out-of-the-box 'Map Orphan Accounts' action.

        "explanation": "To successfully raise access requests for multiple users in Saviynt's Enterprise Identity Cloud (EIC), it is essential to configure the approval workflow for bulk requests at the Security System level. This configuration ensures that bulk access requests are properly routed and managed according to the organization's approval processes. Configuring the workflow at the Endpoint or Global Configuration levels does not provide the necessary scope for handling bulk requests across multiple systems.",

This approach ensures that only entitlements associated with the selected department (dynamic attribute) are displayed in the application request form. According to the use case 'Customize the application request form' in the Saviynt documentation, dynamic attributes and entitlement grouping are configured within the Endpoint Details and Entitlement Type tabs to control visibility and populate entitlements dynamically.

        "explanation": "When a password change request is initiated through the ARS page for another user’s account using the tile 'reset the account password for others', the applicable password policy is determined by the policy assigned at the security system level. Specifically, when the password policy scope is set to 'USER' in the security system's policy rule, it governs password changes for user-centric actions. This approach ensures that the correct password criteria are applied when handling requests involving user accounts. The other options either involve application-level or global configurations, which are not prioritized in this case as the request is scoped to individual user accounts.",

'Multiple Select from List' may seem relevant since it allows selecting multiple values, but it only supports static, predefined lists, making it unsuitable for retrieving live data from the database. 'Multiple Select from SQL Query' is incorrect because it allows selecting multiple values when only a single selection is required.
